## Build & Deploy

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and build the entire engine
make all

# Run performance optimizations
make optimize
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build with enterprise-grade optimizations
make production

# Execute comprehensive test suite

## Expression Engine

### Revolutionary RPN Processor
Our postfix evaluation engine eliminates the computational overhead of traditional infix parsers by leveraging Reverse Polish Notation for direct stack-based computation.

```bash
# Launch interactive expression processor
./mathforge-eval
```

### Real-Time Processing Examples
```bash
$ ./mathforge-eval
> 15.7 23.4 * 2.1 /
175.18
> 100 25 / 3 2 ^ +
13
> 3.14159 2 * 5 ^
9869.58
```

### Enterprise Integration
```bash
# Batch processing for data pipelines
cat financial_calculations.txt | ./mathforge-eval

# High-throughput API integration
echo "portfolio_values.dat" | ./mathforge-eval --batch-mode
```

## CircularDeque™ Technology

### Next-Generation Data Structure
Our CircularDeque implementation revolutionizes traditional queue operations with a patent-pending circular buffer algorithm that maintains O(1) complexity for insertions and deletions at both ends.

### Technical Specifications
- **Bidirectional O(1)**: Push/pop operations at front and back
- **Random Access**: O(1) indexing with `[]` operator
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Intelligent capacity management with 2x growth factor
- **Memory Optimization**: Circular buffer eliminates data shifting overhead

### Performance Validation
```bash
# Execute comprehensive performance benchmarks
./mathforge-deque-tests
```
