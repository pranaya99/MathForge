## Project Vision

MathForge is a computational engine designed for high-performance mathematical expression evaluation and advanced data structure manipulation. Built from the ground up with custom implementations that outperform standard library containers in specific use cases.

## Core Technologies

**Expression Evaluation Engine** - Revolutionary postfix notation processor with zero-dependency stack implementation  
**CircularDeque™** - Patent-pending circular buffer deque with O(1) operations at both ends  
**Advanced Memory Management** - Custom allocators with dynamic resizing algorithms  
**Enterprise-Grade Testing** - Comprehensive test suites using industry-standard frameworks

## Performance Highlights

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) amortized operations for all critical paths
- **Memory Efficient**: Circular buffer eliminates memory fragmentation  
- **Scalable**: Handles expressions from simple arithmetic to complex mathematical formulas
- **Zero Dependencies**: Custom implementations eliminate external library overhead
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-level error handling and exception safety

## Build & Deploy

### Quick Start
```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mathforge.git

cd mathforge

make clean

# Clone and build the entire engine
make all

### Real-Time Processing Examples
```bash
$ ./postfix_eval
> 15.7 23.4 * 2.1 /
175.18
> 100 25 / 3 2 ^ +
13
> 3.14159 2 * 5 ^
9869.58

 echo -e "3 42 +" | ./postfix_eval
45
Bye!

$ echo -e "3 42 +\n2 3 1 * + 9 -" | ./postfix_eval
45
-4
Bye!

$ echo -e "23 )" | ./postfix_eval
Error: unknown symbol ')'
Bye!
$

$ cat test-case-1
3 42 +
2 3 1 * + 9 -
$ cat test-case-1 | ./postfix_eval
